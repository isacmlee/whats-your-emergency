Approximately <b>half</b> of all 911 calls are related to an Emergency Medical Service related incident.<br><br> The top incidents for each category were: fire alarms, vehicle accidents, and respiratory emergencies.</span></h4>

            <h4>Over the last 4 years, the top 5 incidents have been consistent, always within 1-3% of the previous year. In the previous graph we saw that vehicle accidents and disabled vehicles led the way in being the top incidents. Here, we can see that that has been the case over the last 4 years, suggesting that this has been an ongoing issue. <br><br> Although we might have noticed that EMS as a whole accounts for more 911 calls, this is due to there being many more different EMS related calls than traffic incidents. However, we saw that vehicle accidents are the main reason for 911 calls by a large margin, and thus we will focus our efforts on this sole incident moving forward.</h4>
